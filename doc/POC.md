Installing ArgoCD with Helm:
- First, you need to install Helm in your Kubernetes cluster. You can find instructions for this in the official Helm documentation.
- Then add the ArgoCD repository to Helm:
 - `helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm`
 - `helm repo update`
- Use the following command to install ArgoCD using Helm:
 - `helm install argocd argo/argo-cd`
- Configuring access to the ArgoCD graphical interface:
- After installing ArgoCD, access the graphical interface (Web UI). Typically, this can be done by opening ArgoCD using a NodePort or LoadBalancer service.
- To find the IP address or URL to access ArgoCD, use the command:
 - `kubectl get svc argocd-server -n argocd`
- After obtaining the IP address or URL, open a web browser and navigate to this address.
- During the first login, you may need a login and password. You can find them using the command:
 - `kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 --decode`
