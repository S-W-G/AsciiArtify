| Supported OS           | Linux, macOS, Windows                                  | Linux, macOS, Windows                                | Linux, macOS, Windows                                |
| Supported Hypervisors  | VirtualBox, Hyper-V, KVM, Docker                       | Docker                                               | Docker, Podman (Docker alternative)                 |
| Automation            | Supports automation with Kubernetes CLI   | Supports automation with Kubernetes CLI | Supports automation with Kubernetes CLI |
| Additional features         | Built-in Kubernetes Dashboard, Ingress support, multi-cluster environment | Ease of creating clusters with custom configurations, ability to test Kubernetes features at a low level | Support for creating clusters with different configurations, ability to use Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) |
| Pros                 | Easy to use, well-documented, supported by a large community, allows easy switching between hypervisors | Easy creation and launch of clusters in Docker containers, fast startup, support for low-level Kubernetes feature testing | Support for alternative container runtimes, such as Podman, fast cluster startup, ability to use Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) |
| Cons                  | Runs on a virtual machine, which can be slower compared to running on containers, limited scalability options | Limited to Docker as the container runtime, relatively new technology with less community support | Relatively new technology with less community support, may be more complex to configure compared to minikube or kind |


In this demonstration, I will show you how to deploy a simple "Hello World" application on Kubernetes using k3d. I recommend using k3d for the startup "AsciiArtify" due to its flexibility, fast deployment, and support for alternative container runtimes, such as Podman.
